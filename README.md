# AutoHotKey keyboards

AutoHotKey keyboard maps for some non-Latin scripts.

- The Sanskrit/Devanagari keyboard is based on the [WX transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WX_notation) scheme.

- The Kannada/Carnatic keyboard is analogous to the Sanskrit keyboard.

- The Tengwar keyboard for writing Quenya and Ãžindarin is inspired by [this layout](https://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/keylayouts.html).

- The Greek keyboard follows the [Beta code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code). For Ancient Greek, see [this](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?style=2&f=6&t=56260) post.

- The Zbalermorna keyboard for writing Lojban is based on the system described [here](https://jackhumbert.github.io/zbalermorna/write-up/).

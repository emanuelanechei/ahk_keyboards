# AutoHotKey keyboards

AutoHotKey keyboard maps for some non-Latin scripts.

The Sanskrit keyboard is based on the [WX transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WX_notation) scheme.

The Kannada keyboard is analogous to the Sanskrit keyboard.

The Tengwar keyboard is inspired by [this layout](https://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/keylayouts.html) from the Free Tengwar Project.

The Greek keyboard follows the [Beta code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code). For Ancient Greek, see [this](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?style=2&f=6&t=56260) post.
